# intent
Vocab about Offer, Request, Want, Need, Desire, predecessors to [exchanges](https://github.com/openvocab/exchange).

We see many groups posting intents that are different from commercial advertisements or ecommerce offers.

They are more general, often not commercial at all, expressed not in identified products but in categories, tags, and text.  But they want to find each other. The offers want to find the matching wants. The wants want to find the matching offers.

When they find their match, those with the matching offer and want enter into a conversation for action which might result in an [exchange](https://github.com/openvocab/exchange).

Some of the groups we have seen posting these intents include Mutual Aid Networks and Mutual Credit Associations.

The aim of this repository is to collect their use cases and potential valueflows vocabulary additions.
